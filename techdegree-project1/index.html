        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am 19 years old and from Perth, Western Australia.  I just learned about coding this year and am completely fascinated by it and want to learn as much as I can with ambitions to land a professional job one day.</p>
        <p>My father is from the Phillipines and my mother is born in Australia but her parents are both from the Netherlands. So while I claim to be Australian I also have Filipino and Dutch heritage.</p>
        <p>I love music and sports. I am a huge fan of rap and RnB, from old school all the way through to modern day artists. My favourite sports are basketball, bodybuilding and football (soccer). </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and apps and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to develop my skillset until I can apply as a Junior Front End Developer. I want to learn iOS development and build apps as a hobby. I also want to learn about the backend side of development and if I like it then look at becoming a full stack developer.</p>
