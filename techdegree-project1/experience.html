        <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
        <p>I have had three jobs since graduating high school two years ago. My first job was as a songwriter, I did this part time during high school and then full time once I finished. My second job was as a visual merchandiser. At this job I set up large scale displays and Christmas trees throughout the city and shopping centres.</p>
        <p>My third and current job is at a youth organisation. Here I have various roles which can range from travelling interstate delivering equipment and assistance to regional centres and taking youths on excursions in the city. This is a very rewarding job which I am very grateful to have.</p>
        <p>Since I have learned about coding websites I have decided that this is the industry that I want to enter and begin my proper career with. I am very excited about the future and eager to create work that can be shared around the world. I also would like to be a firefighter one day but still be a Front End Developer on the side, possibly freelancing.</p>
